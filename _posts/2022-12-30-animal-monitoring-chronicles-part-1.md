Low Resource Wildlife Monitoring
======================

*Introduction

With advances in remote sensing technology, there is excitment around new ways to tackle some of the sustainable developing goals. In this project, I focus on goals 2 (addressing food security) and 15 (protect and restore terrestrial ecosystems) while being mindful of goal 13 (combating climate change). Even though my end goal is for use cases in developing countries, I had a test bed in a farm in Eastern Washington that had limited access to cellular networks and limited access to power supply. *TODO: add summary*

*The Setup

*Challenges

Weather and access 
The farm is setup on a hilly terrain and so it makes sense to have the observation station on top of the hill. During dry seasons (late spring through early fall), it’s decently easy to go up there with a gator. Though I was hesitant to drive it solo at first, given I was a new driver, it’s actually fun. However, during the winter, it’s much harder to get up there with the gator so you’d go on foot and it’s a good idea to carry handwarmers.

When the setup is far from base station but weather is not favorable

When you are working from a far location (with one person to help with the setup)

Working with new hardware with little support (and it getting phased out eventually)

Percept shorted

Being at the forefront of the a heterogeneous hardware/software ecosystem with fast moving development

When you have access to TVWS and when you don't 

*Some Lessons
    - Joining Gloire’s paper session made me realize I had been very narrowly focused on what ad hoc solution I can come up with in the moment and that’s there’s actually a wealth of information around research field work that I skipped over. The plan is to delve into the literature for ideas. Who knows? I might have a follow up blog if I find interesting insights.
    
    - Setting up a remote station to debug from sounds nice in theory but can be challenging in practice. Device fails and you try to get an assistant at the remote site to help you debug over the phone but you get lucky less than half the time in resolving the issue [most likely a good idea to have a replica of the setup with you]
    - Project involved being able to work with hardware (wiring from solar panel and taking a fixed voltage into the voltage and amperage rating of your devices, networking skills to debug when the TVWS router is not detecting your device [other way round?] and of course coding skills to setup remote access) → provide links?
    - In hindsight, the project started with far too many moving parts. Starting with too many moving parts
    - Tension between developing remotely and developing on the ground
    - What reading material did I look for to be better prepared next time?
    
   - Working in isolation
