Low Resource Wildlife Monitoring
======================

- A typical day on the farm
    - The farm is setup on a hilly terrain and so it makes sense to have the observation station on top of the hill. During dry seasons (late spring through early fall), it’s decently easy to go up there with a gator. Though I was hesitant to drive it solo at first, given I was a new driver, it’s actually fun. However, during the winter, it’s much harder to get up there with the gator so you’d go on foot and it’s a good idea to carry handwarmers.
- Some observations
    - Joining Gloire’s paper session made me realize I had been very narrowly focused on what ad hoc solution I can come up with in the moment and that’s there’s actually a wealth of information around research field work that I skipped over. The plan is to delve into the literature for ideas. Who knows? I might have a follow up blog if I find interesting insights.
    - Setting up a remote station to debug from sounds nice in theory but can be challenging in practice. Device fails and you try to get an assistant at the remote site to help you debug over the phone but you get lucky less than half the time in resolving the issue [most likely a good idea to have a replica of the setup with you]
    - Project involved being able to work with hardware (wiring from solar panel and taking a fixed voltage into the voltage and amperage rating of your devices, networking skills to debug when the TVWS router is not detecting your device [other way round?] and of course coding skills to setup remote access) → provide links?

When the setup is far from base station but weather is not favorable

When you are working from a far location (with one person to help with the setup)

Working with new hardware with little support (and it getting phased out eventually)

Starting with too many moving parts

Curse of being at the forefront of the a heterogeneous hardware/software ecosystem with fast moving development

Working in isolation

Tension between developing remotely and developing on the ground

When you have access to TVWS and when you don't 

- What reading material did I look for to be better prepared next time?
