Hello, I am a second year graduate student in the Computer Science and Engineering department within the University of Washington. I’m currently working in the [ICTD lab](https://ictd.cs.washington.edu) working with [Kurtis Heimerl](https://kurti.sh) and [Luis Vega](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~vegaluis/) from the [SAMPA lab](https://sampa.cs.washington.edu/new/index.html). I received both my bachelor’s degree in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science and Master of Engineering degree in Computer Science from MIT.

My research broadly addresses ways to make machine learning algorithms more applicable in low resource settings. Due to this interest, I closely follow work in edge machine learning, federated learning and hardware-software codesign of machine learning algorithms. At present, I’m looking at energy efficient ways to use various edge devices (android phone, raspberry pi and Azure percept) to perform wildlife detection in an effort to protect farm crops from destruction. For this project, I look at both a multimodal approach for the detection (video and sound) as well as the edge optimization for energy efficiency. This is a joint project with [Farmbeats](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/project/farmbeats-iot-agriculture/) and [Nelson Farms](https://www.facebook.com/farmingtherollinghills/) in Eastern Washington.
